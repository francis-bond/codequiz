Summary

Play a game where you answer questions while timed. 
The game keeps track of your score and when the game ends, it lets you set your initials to the game.


Development

Ran into a few roadblock while working through this assignment. Biggest one being how to iterate through the questions most efficiently.

To encounter less problems on the next homework, I will pseudocode my homework and before coding, get some feedback on my approach.
